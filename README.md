## Our process

### Built with

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails 7
- PostgreSQL
- Stimulus JS
- AJAX
- Hotwire Turbo
- HTML
- SASS
- Bootstrap


### Learnings + future focus

The main purpose of this project was to practice creating a marketplace using Ruby on Rails framework and modern web development workflow. It was a great way to master all basic CRUD actions, practice using AJAX for dynamic searching as well as using Turbo Streams to apply rails validations and render errors to users.

Possible future steps:
- Adding a mobile version
- Adding a calendar so that users can see when the item is already rented out
- Adding confirmation system for bookings: a new booking is pending until the owner of the item confirms it
- Integration with Stripe to allow online payments after booking
- Further refactoring
